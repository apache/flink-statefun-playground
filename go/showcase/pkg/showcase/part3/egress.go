// EgressFn
//   Showcase Part 3: Sending messages to egresses
//
//   ============================
//
//   To let your StateFun application interact with the outside world, functions may write messages
//   to egresses. This function demonstrates sending messages to an Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis
//   egress, which is currently our most commonly used egresses that are natively supported by StateFun.
//
//   ============================
//
//   Next, we recommend learning about StateFun's state storage management and how to access stored
//   values. Head over to StateStorageFn.

	ctx.SendEgress(statefun.KafkaEgressBuilder{
		Target: KafkaEgressTypeName,
		Topic:  "my-kafka-topic",
		Key:    "my-key",
		Value:  "hello world!",
	})

	ctx.SendEgress(statefun.KinesisEgressBuilder{
		Target:          KinesisEgressTypeName,
		Stream:          "my-kinesis-stream",
		Value:           "hello world again!",
		PartitionKey:    "my-partition-key",
		ExplicitHashKey: "my-explicit-hash-key",
	})

// Egresses are associated with a unique TypeName. The typename is used to identify which
// egress a message should be sent to.
//
// StateFun currently has native support for using Apache Kafka topics or AWS Kinesis streams
// as egresses.
//
// Registering a Kafka or Kinesis egress under a given TypeName is beyond the scope of
// what this specific part of the tutorial is attempting to demonstrate. For the time being,
// you can simply assume that a Kafka egress has been registered under the typename
// literal `golang.showcase.io/my-kafka-egress` and a Kinesis egress has been registered
// under the typename literal `golang.showcase.io/my-kinesis-egress`.
